    <h3>A brief History of the Nacho Dish</h3>
    <p>Nachos originated in 1943 in Piedras Negras, Mexico, a border town near Texas. The story goes that a group of U.S. soldiers visiting a restaurant owned by Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya found themselves in need of a snack after the kitchen had closed. Anaya improvised by layering tortilla chips with melted cheese and jalapeños, creating a simple yet flavorful dish.

        The dish quickly gained popularity and spread across the border into the United States. In the 1970s, nachos made their way into stadiums and sports arenas, solidifying their status as a favorite snack for fans. Over the years, variations have emerged, with toppings ranging from guacamole and sour cream to meats and vegetables.
        
        Today, nachos are enjoyed worldwide and are a staple at parties, restaurants, and home gatherings, celebrated for their versatility and deliciousness.</p>
