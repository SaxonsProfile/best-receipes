   <p><h3>A Brief History of Tacos</h3></p>
   <p>The history of tacos dates back to ancient Mexico, where indigenous people, including the Aztecs, used corn tortillas to hold various fillings. The modern taco as we know it began to take shape in the 19th century, particularly in the silver mining towns of central Mexico, where miners would eat simple meals wrapped in tortillas. Tacos gained popularity throughout the 20th century, especially with the rise of street food culture and the introduction of hard-shell tacos in the United States in the 1940s. Today, tacos are a global phenomenon, celebrated for their versatility and flavor, with countless variations reflecting regional tastes and ingredients.</p>
